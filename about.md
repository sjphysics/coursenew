## About

This website includes notes, content, videos, articles, websites, and any other thing I deem useful for the delivery of proper physics knowledge. It is important that you visit this website at least every day or every time after a physics class to check when the website has been updated.

## Lecture

We have five meetings a week, which means half of the time will be used for lectures while the other half is going to be used for practice. A hard following of this schedule might not be possible as some classes may require more practice and others, less. To make the classroom meetings ideal, you have to 
- participate
- ask questions
- answer questions

## Resources

Most of the resources will be prepared by me and we will mainly be using a few different additional resources.

- [Openstax AP Physics](https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics-ap-courses)
- [Khan Acaemy](https://khanacademy.org)
- [New MOE Textbook](/23-24/textbook/textbook.pdf) 

## Assignments

Most of the assignment problems would be based on questions and ideas we discuss during class, but some questions would be a little open-ended and would require thinking beyond just what we saw in class. Coincidentally, I am sure such questions will be the more fun ones.  

## Projects

If, at any point, you have some project in mind and you would like to collaborate or need advising, don't hesitate to reach out!
