<p>We have introduced the concepts of position, velocity and acceleration to describe motion in one dimension; however we live in a multidimensional universe.<br />
<br />
To do that, we must extend our definitions of position, velocity, and acceleration for an object that moves in two dimensions by treating each direction independently, which we can do with vector quantities by resolving each of these quantities into their components defined by the basis vectors. For example, our definition of velocity as the derivative of position holds for each component separately. In Cartesian coordinates, the position vector <span class="math inline"><em>r⃗</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> with respect to some choice of origin for the object at time t is given by <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}(t)=x(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+y(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}}$$</span><br /> The velocity vector <span class="math inline"><em>v⃗</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> at time t is the derivative of the position vector, <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}(t)=\frac{d x(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\frac{d y(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{j}} = v_{x}(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+v_{y}(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}} \nonumber$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline">$v_{x}(t) =\dfrac{dx(t)}{dt}$</span> and <span class="math inline">$v_{y}(t) = \dfrac{dy(t)}{dt}$</span> denote the x - and y -components of the velocity respectively. The acceleration vector <span class="math inline"><em>a⃗</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> is defined in a similar fashion as the derivative of the velocity vector, <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}(t)=\frac{d v_{x}(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\frac{d v_{y}(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{j}} = a_{x}(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+a_{y}(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}}$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline">$a_x(t)=\dfrac{dv_x(t)}{dt}$</span> and <span class="math inline">$a_y(t)=\dfrac{dv_y(t)}{dt}$</span> denote the x- and y-components of the acceleration.<br />
<br />
The natural way we should start two dimensional motion should be projectile motion. However, we have discussed projectile motion last year and redundancy would not suffice, hence we will be moving forward with the next common topic in 2D motion, which is circular motion.</p>
<h2 id="circular-motion" class="unnumbered">Circular Motion</h2>
<p>A special class of motions, motion in a plane about a central point, a motion we shall refer to as <strong>central motion</strong>, the most outstanding case of which is <strong>circular motion</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let’s begin by describing the kinematics of circular motion. We see that unlike linear motion, where velocity and acceleration are directed along the line of motion, in circular motion the direction of velocity is always tangent to the circle. This means that as the object moves in a circle, the direction of the velocity is always changing. We also see that the direction of the change of the velocity is towards the center of the circle. This means that there is a non-zero component of the acceleration directed radially inward, which is called the centripetal acceleration. If our object is increasing its speed or slowing down, there is also a non-zero tangential acceleration in the direction of motion. But when the object is moving at a constant speed in a circle then only the centripetal acceleration is non-zero.<br />
<br />
Twenty years before Newton published Principia Mathematica, he realized that the moon is always “falling” towards the center of the earth; otherwise, by the First Law, it would continue in some linear trajectory rather than follow a circular orbit. Therefore there must be a centripetal force, a radial force pointing inward, producing this centripetal acceleration.<br />
<br />
When an object is constrained to move in a circle, there must exist a force <span class="math inline"><em>F⃗</em></span> acting on the object directed towards the center. Because Newton’s Second Law is a vector equality, the radial component of the Second Law is <br /><span class="math display"><em>F</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> = <em>m</em><em>a</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span><br /> Let’s start with the kinematics of circular motion. We begin our description of circular motion by choosing polar coordinates(<em>because they are obviously much better in this sense</em>). In the figure below we sketch the position vector <span class="math inline">$\vec{r(t)}$</span> of the object moving in a circular orbit of radius r.</p>
<p><img src="circ.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>At time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, the particle is located at the point P with coordinates <span class="math inline">(<em>r</em>, <em>θ</em>(<em>t</em>))</span> and position vector given by <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}(t)=r \hat{\mathbf{r}}(t)$$</span><br /> At the point P, consider two sets of unit vectors (<span class="math inline"><em>r̂</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>θ̂</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>) and (<span class="math inline"><em>î</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>ĵ</em></span>), as shown in the figure above. The vector decomposition expression for <span class="math inline"><em>r̂</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>θ̂</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline"><em>î</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>ĵ</em></span> is given by <br /><span class="math display">$$\hat{\mathbf{r}}(t)=\cos \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\sin \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}}$$</span><br /> <br /><span class="math display">$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)=-\sin \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\cos \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}}$$</span><br /> To calculate the velocities, we should compute the derivative of the functions above. For the first one(<span class="math inline">$\vec{\mathbf{v}}(t)=\dfrac{d\vec{r}(t)}{dt}$</span>), <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{array}{l} 
        \frac{d \hat{\mathbf{r}}(t)}{d t}=\frac{d}{d t}(\cos \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\sin \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}})=\left(-\sin \theta(t) \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\cos \theta(t) \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right) \\ 
        =\frac{d \theta(t)}{d t}(-\sin \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\cos \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}})=\frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{\theta}}(t) 
    \end{array} \nonumber$$</span><br /> For the second vector, which is <span class="math inline">$\vec{\boldsymbol{\omega}}=\dfrac{d\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)}{dt}$</span>, <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{array}{l} 
        \frac{d \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)}{d t}=\frac{d}{d t}\left(-\sin \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\cos \theta(t \hat{\mathbf{j}})=\left(-\cos \theta(t) \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{i}}-\sin (t) \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right)\right. \\ 
        =\frac{d \theta(t)}{d t}(-\cos \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}-\sin \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}})=-\frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{r}}(t) 
    \end{array} \nonumber$$</span><br /> From the above relationship, we get the following expression below which gives us the velocity vector, <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}(t)=\frac{d \overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}(t)}{d t}=r \frac{d \hat{\mathbf{r}}}{d t}=r \frac{d \theta}{d t} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)=v_{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t) \nonumber$$</span><br /> where the <span class="math inline">$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$</span>-component of the velocity is given by <br /><span class="math display">$$v_{\theta}=r \frac{d \theta}{d t} \nonumber$$</span><br /> <span class="math inline"><em>v⃗</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> is referred to as the tangential component of the velocity. Denote the magnitude of the velocity by <span class="math inline"><em>v</em> = |<em>v⃗</em>|</span>. The angular speed is the magnitude of the rate of change of angle with respect to time, which we denote by the Greek letter <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em></span>, <br /><span class="math display">$$\omega \equiv\left|\frac{d \theta}{d t}\right| \nonumber$$</span><br /> We can also geometrically derive the equations above which are left for you, the readers aka the students :).</p>
<h3 id="acceleration" class="unnumbered">Acceleration</h3>
<p>When the motion of an object is described in polar coordinates, the acceleration has two components, the tangential component,<span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub></span> and the radial component, <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span>. We can write the acceleration vector as <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}=a_{r} \hat{\mathbf{r}}(t)+a_{\theta} \hat{=\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)$$</span><br /> It is, however, important to note that the unit vectors <span class="math inline"><em>r̂</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>θ̂</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> change <strong>direction</strong> and hence are not constant in time.<br />
<br />
Assuming that the tangential velocity <span class="math inline">$v_\theta=r\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$</span> is changing in magnitude due to the presence of some tangential force; we consider that <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$</span> is changing in time, (the magnitude of the velocity is changing in time). Recall that in polar coordinates the velocity vector can be written as <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}(t)=r \frac{d \theta}{d t} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)$$</span><br /> We now use the product rule to determine the acceleration: <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}(t)=\frac{d \overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}(t)}{d t}=r \frac{d^{2} \theta(t)}{d t^{2}} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)+r \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \frac{d \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)}{d t}$$</span><br /> The equation above can be re-written as <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}(t)=r \frac{d^{2} \theta(t)}{d t^{2}} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)+r \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \frac{d}{d t}(-\sin \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\cos \theta(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}})$$</span><br /> Using the chain rule, we get the following result <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}(t)=r \frac{d^{2} \theta(t)}{d t^{2}} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)+r \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t}\left(-\cos \theta(t) \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{i}}-\sin \theta(t) \frac{d \theta(t)}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right)$$</span><br /> Which simplifies easily to the next result <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}(t)=r \frac{d^{2} \theta(t)}{d t^{2}} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(t)-r\left(\frac{d \theta(t)}{d t}\right)^{2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}(t)$$</span><br /> The tangential component of the acceleration(in the direction of <span class="math inline"><strong>θ̂</strong></span>) is then <br /><span class="math display">$$a_{\theta}=r \frac{d^{2} \theta(t)}{d t^{2}}$$</span><br /> The radial component of the acceleration(in the direction of <span class="math inline"><strong>r̂</strong></span>) becomes <br /><span class="math display">$$a_{r}=-r\left(\frac{d \theta(t)}{d t}\right)^{2}=-r \omega^{2}$$</span><br /> The negative sign in <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span> shows that the acceleration is always directed inwards, hence the <strong>centripetal</strong> acceleration.</p>
<h2 id="period-and-frequency-for-uniform-circular-motion" class="unnumbered">Period and Frequency for Uniform Circular Motion</h2>
<p>One thing we know for sure because of Newton’s Second Law is that if an object is constrained to move in a circle and the total tangential force acting on it is zero, <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub><sup><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sup> = 0</span> then, the tangential acceleration is zero <span class="math inline"> ⟹ <em>a</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub> = 0</span>.<br />
<br />
This means that the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) remains constant. This motion is known as <strong>uniform circular motion</strong>. The acceleration is then given by only the acceleration radial component vector, <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}_{r}(t)=-r \omega^{2}(t) \hat{\mathbf{r}}(t)$$</span><br /> Because the speed <span class="math inline"><em>v</em> = <em>r</em>|<em>ω</em>|</span> is constant, the amount of time that the object takes to complete one circular orbit of radius <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is also constant. This time interval, <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> , is called the <strong>period</strong>. In one period, the object travels a distance <span class="math inline"><em>s</em> = <em>v</em><em>T</em></span> equal to the circumference, <span class="math inline"><em>s</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>r</em></span>; thus <br /><span class="math display"><em>s</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>r</em> = <em>v</em><em>T</em></span><br /> The period <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> is then given by <br /><span class="math display">$$T=\frac{2 \pi r}{v}=\frac{2 \pi r}{r \omega}=\frac{2 \pi}{\omega}$$</span><br /> We also know that the frequency, <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, is defined to be the reciprocal of the period, <br /><span class="math display">$$f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{\omega}{2 \pi}$$</span><br /> The magnitude of the radial component of the acceleration can be expressed in different forms since both the magnitudes of the velocity and angular velocity are related by <span class="math inline"><em>v</em> = <em>r</em><em>ω</em></span>. Thus, we have several alternative forms for the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">|<em>a</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>| = <em>r</em><em>ω</em><sup>2</sup></span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">$\left|a_{r}\right|=\dfrac{v^{2}}{r}$</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">|<em>a</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>| = 4<em>π</em><sup>2</sup><em>r</em><em>f</em><sup>2</sup></span>, since <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em> = 2<em>π</em><em>f</em></span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">$\left|a_{r}\right|=\dfrac{4 \pi^{2} r}{T^{2}}$</span>, since <span class="math inline"><em>f</em> = 1/<em>T</em> = <em>ω</em>/2<em>π</em></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Often, we decide which expression to use based on information that describes the trajectory. An important measure might be the trajectory’s radius. We may also independently know the period, or the frequency, or the angular velocity, or the speed. If we know one, we can calculate the other three but it is important to understand the meaning of each quantity.<br />
<br />
<em>The next section is optional, but might be interesting for some of you. I definitely recommend reading it, because it does help visualize the quantities</em></p>
<h3 id="more-on-angular-velocity-and-angular-acceleration" class="unnumbered">More on Angular Velocity and Angular Acceleration</h3>
<p>We shall always choose a right-handed cylindrical coordinate system. If the positive z - axis points up, then we choose <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> to be increasing in the counterclockwise direction as shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="rhr.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>For a point object undergoing circular motion about the z-axis, the angular velocity vector <span class="math inline"><em>ω⃗</em></span> is directed along the z -axis with z -component equal to the time derivative of the angle <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>, <br /><span class="math display">$$\vec{\omega}=\frac{d \theta}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{k}}=\omega_{z} \hat{\mathbf{k}}$$</span><br /> It is important to note that the angular speed is just the magnitude of the z -component of the angular velocity, <br /><span class="math display">$$\omega \equiv\left|\omega_{z}\right|=\left|\frac{d \theta}{d t}\right|$$</span><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the velocity of the object is in the <span class="math inline"> + <em>θ̂</em></span>-direction, (rotating in the counterclockwise direction), then the z -component of the angular velocity is positive, <span class="math inline">$\omega_{z}=\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}&gt;0$</span>. The angular velocity vector then points in the <span class="math inline"> + <em>k̂</em></span>-direction.</p></li>
<li><p>If the velocity of the object is in the <span class="math inline"> − <em>θ̂</em></span>-direction, (rotating in the clockwise direction), then the z -component of the angular velocity angular velocity is negative, <span class="math inline">$\omega_{z}=\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}&lt;0$</span>. The angular velocity vector then points in the <span class="math inline"> − <em>k̂</em></span>-direction. Thus, we can see that the velocity and angular velocity are related by <br /><span class="math display">$$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{\omega}} \times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}=\frac{d \theta}{d t} \hat{\mathbf{k}} \times r \hat{\mathbf{r}}=r \frac{d \theta}{d t} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$$</span><br /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, for a point object undergoing circular motion about the fixed z -axis, the angular acceleration is defined as <br /><span class="math display">$$\vec{\alpha}=\frac{d^{2} \theta}{d t^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{k}}=\alpha_{z} \hat{\mathbf{k}}$$</span><br /> The magnitude of the angular acceleration is denoted by the Greek symbol alpha, <br /><span class="math display">$$\alpha \equiv|\vec{\alpha}|=\left|\frac{d^{2} \theta}{d t^{2}}\right|$$</span><br /> There are four special cases to consider for the direction of the angular velocity. Let’s first consider the two types of motion with <span class="math inline">$\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}$</span> pointing in the <span class="math inline"><em>k̂</em></span>-direction.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the object is rotating counterclockwise and speeding up, then both <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}&gt;0$</span> and <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}&gt;0$</span></p></li>
<li><p>If the object is rotating clockwise and slowing down, then <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}&lt;0$</span> but <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}&gt;0$</span>.<br />
<em>There are two other corresponding cases in which</em><span class="math inline">$\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}$</span> <em>is pointing in the</em> <span class="math inline"> − <em>k̂</em></span>-<em>direction</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the object is rotating counterclockwise and slowing down then <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}&gt;0$</span> and <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}&lt;0$</span></p></li>
<li><p>If the object is rotating clockwise and speeding up then both <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}&lt;0$</span> and <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}&lt;0$</span></p></li>
</ol>
