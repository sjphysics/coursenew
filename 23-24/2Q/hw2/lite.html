<li><p>The homework is due on <strong>Thursday</strong>, <strong>December 4th</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>You should Work on it <strong>in the newly organized groups</strong> and consult me if you have any questions. As I have reiterated multiple times, cheating between groups will have a serious consequence.</p></li>
<li><p>For purposes of neatness and simplicity of grading, you should do the homework on an <strong>A-4 paper</strong>. However, use your exercise book as a scrapbook.</p></li>
<li><p>All answers should be written using a pen. Do not use a pencil. If you make an error, strike a line through it and correct it on the next line.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are attempting the <strong>Advanced Problems</strong>, your submission should be <strong>via email</strong>. The <strong>Advanced Problems</strong> have the same deadline as the rest of the problems.</p></li>

<p>Answer the following questions based on the position versus time graph given below of an object moving.</p>

<p>The acceleration of a particle moving along the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-axis is given by the equation: <br /><span class="math display">$$a \left( t \right) = \left(0.500\frac{m}{s^3}\right)t + \left(2.70 \frac{m}{s^2}\right)$$</span><br /> If the particle is at position <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> =  + 5.12<em>m</em></span> and is moving in the <span class="math inline"> − <em>x</em></span> direction at a speed of <span class="math inline">12.8<em>m</em>/<em>s</em></span> at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0<em>s</em></span>,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Find the time at which the particle momentarily comes to rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the position where the particle (briefly) comes to rest.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A ball is thrown vertically upward at the same instant that a second ball is dropped from rest directly above it. The two balls are <span class="math inline">15.0<em>m</em></span> apart when they start their motion. Find the maximum speed at which the first ball can be thrown such that it doesn’t collide with the second ball before it returns to its starting height. The starting conditions of two cars at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> are shown in the figure below. The green car, G, starts out 2 <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> ahead of the pink car, P. At <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> the pink car is moving to the right at 2 <span class="math inline"><em>m</em>/<em>s</em></span>, while the green car is moving to the right at 5 <span class="math inline"><em>m</em>/<em>s</em></span>. The pink car is accelerating to the right with magnitude of 6 <span class="math inline"><em>m</em>/<em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span>, while the green car is accelerating to the left with with magnitude of 4 <span class="math inline"><em>m</em>/<em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span>. Assume acceleration is constant for both cars. Define the origin at the location of the pink car at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span>.</p>
<p><img src="q4.png" alt="image" /></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Calculate the time when the pink car catches up to the green one.</p></li>
<li><p>At which positions do the two cars meet?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A car is driving through a green light at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> located at <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 0</span> with an initial speed <span class="math inline"><em>v</em><sub><em>i</em>, <em>c</em></sub> = 16<em>m</em>/<em>s</em></span>. At time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub>1</sub> = 1<em>s</em></span>, the car starts braking until it comes to rest at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub>2</sub></span>. The acceleration of the car as a function of time is given by the piece-wise function <br /><span class="math display">$$a_{c}(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{l} 
            0 ; \quad 0&lt;t&lt;t_{1}=1 \mathrm{s} \\ 
            b\left(t-t_{1}\right) ; 1 \mathrm{s}&lt;t&lt;t_{2} 
        \end{array}\right. \nonumber$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>b</em> =  − (8<em>m</em>/<em>s</em><sup>3</sup>)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assuming the car travels only in the x-direction, find the velocity and the position of the car as a function of time.</p></li>
<li><p>A bicycle rider is riding at a constant speed of <span class="math inline"><em>V</em><sub><em>i</em>, <em>b</em></sub></span> and at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> is 32 m behind the car. The bicyclist reaches the car when the car just comes to rest. What is the speed of the bicycle?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At the instant a traffic light turns green, a car starts from rest with a given constant acceleration, <span class="math inline">3.0<em>m</em>/<em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span>. Just as the light turns green, a bus, traveling with a given constant velocity, <span class="math inline">18<em>m</em>/<em>s</em></span>, passes the car. The car speeds up and passes the bus sometime later. How far down the road has the car traveled, when the car passes the bus? A car, starting at rest at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span>, accelerates in a straight line for 140 m with an unknown constant acceleration. It reaches a speed of 12 <span class="math inline"><em>m</em>/<em>s</em></span> and then continues at this speed for another 20 s.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write down the equations for the position and velocity of the car as a function of time.</p></li>
<li><p>How long was the car accelerating?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the magnitude of the acceleration?</p></li>
<li><p>Plot speed vs. time, acceleration vs. time, and position vs. time for the entire motion.</p></li>
<li><p>What was the average velocity for the entire trip?</p></li>
