<h3 id="one-dimensional-kinematics" class="unnumbered">One Dimensional Kinematics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The motion of a particle in one dimension can be described using the function <span class="math inline"><em>x</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> that gives its position at any time. Its velocity is defined by the derivative <span class="math inline">$v=\dfrac{dx}{dt}$</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>From the definition, we see that the SI units of velocity are meters per second, m/s. Positive and negative signs indicate the direction of motion, relative to the direction that is arbitrarily called positive when we pick our coordinate system. In the case of constant velocity, we have <span class="math inline">$v=\dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$</span>, where the notation <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em></span> (Greek uppercase “delta,” like Latin “D”) means “change in,” or “final minus initial.” When the velocity is not constant, this equation is false, although the quantity <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$</span> can be interpreted as a kind of average velocity.</p></li>
<li><p>Velocity can only be defined if we choose some arbitrary reference point that we consider to be at rest. Therefore velocity is relative, not absolute. A person aboard a cruising passenger jet might consider the cabin to be at rest, but someone on the ground might say that the plane was moving very fast — relative to the dirt.</p></li>
<li><p>The acceleration of a particle is defined as the time derivative of the velocity, or the second derivative of the position with respect to time <span class="math inline">$a=\dfrac{dv}{dt}=\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2}$</span></p></li>
<li><p>Unlike velocity, acceleration is not just a matter of opinion. Observers in different inertial frames of reference agree on accelerations. An acceleration is caused by the force that one object exerts on another.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="circular-motion" class="unnumbered">Circular Motion</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Circular motion requires a force with a component toward the center of the circle. Uniform circular motion is the special case in which the speed is constant. In uniform circular motion, the acceleration vector is toward the center, and therefore total force acting on the object must point directly toward the center.</p></li>
<li><p>We can define the angular velocity <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em></span>, which is the number of radians per second by which the object’s angle changes, <span class="math inline">$\omega=\dfrac{d\omega}{dt}$</span>. For uniform circular motion, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em></span> is constant, and the magnitude of the acceleration is <span class="math inline">$a=\omega^2r=\dfrac{v^2}{r}$</span> where r is the radius of the circle. These expressions can also be related to the period of the rotation <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span>, which is the time for one revolution. We have <span class="math inline">$\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}$</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Show that the expression <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sup>2</sup><em>r</em></span> has the units of acceleration. On a 30 km bike ride, you ride the first 10 km at an average speed of 8 km/hour. What average speed must you have over the next 12km if your average speed for the whole ride is to be 18 km/hour? An object starts moving at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span>, and its position is given by <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = <em>A</em><em>t</em><sup>5</sup> − <em>B</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup></span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is in seconds and <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is in meters. A is a non-zero constant.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Infer the units of A and B.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the velocity as a function of <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the average velocity from <span class="math inline">0</span> to <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> as a function of time?</p></li>
<li><p>At what time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> <span class="math inline">(<em>t</em> &gt; 0)</span> is the velocity at t equal to the average velocity from <span class="math inline">0</span> to <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You’re standing on the roof of a building, which is 13.0 meters above the ground. You have a rock in your hand, which you can throw with a maximum speed of 12.0 m/s.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How long would it take for the rock to hit the ground if you released the rock from rest?</p></li>
<li><p>How long would it take for the rock to hit the ground if you threw the rock straight downward?</p></li>
<li><p>How long would it take for the rock to hit the ground if you threw the rock straight upward?</p></li>
<li><p>If you threw the rock straight upward, how high would it get above the ground?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the acceleration due to gravity on a planet is <span class="math inline">$\frac{1}{4}$</span> that on Earth, how many times longer does it take for a rock to drop the same distance on the planet? The graph below represents the motion of a ball that rolls up a hill and then back down. When does the ball return to the location it had at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span>? Also, express the velocity and acceleration as functions of time.</p>

<li><p>Express the chain rule in Leibniz (“d”) notation, and show that it always results in an answer whose units make sense.</p></li>
<li><p>An object has a position as a function of time given by <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = <em>A</em>cos (<em>b</em><em>t</em>)</span>, where A and b are constants. Infer the units of A and b, and interpret their physical meanings.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the velocity of this object, and check that the chain rule has indeed given an answer with the right units.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A honeybee’s position as a function of time is given by <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 10<em>t</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>t</em><sup>5</sup></span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is in seconds and <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> in meters. What is its velocity at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3.0<em>s</em></span>? Assume you are an astronaut, and you’ve arrived on some planet P, which has no atmosphere. You drop a hammer from a height of 1.00 m and find that it takes 10ms to fall to the ground. What is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet P? Objects A and B, with <span class="math inline"><em>v</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> graphs shown in the figure, both leave the origin at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0<em>s</em></span>. When do they cross paths again?</p>
<p><img src="graph2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Starting from rest, a ball rolls down a ramp, traveling a distance L and picking up a final speed <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span>. How much of the distance did the ball have to cover before achieving a speed of <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{v}{2}$</span>? You climb half-way up a tree, and drop a rock. Then you climb to the top, and drop another rock. How many times greater is the velocity of the second rock on impact? Some fleas can jump as high as <span class="math inline">30<em>c</em><em>m</em></span>. The flea only has a short time to build up speed — the time during which its center of mass is accelerating upward but its feet are still in contact with the ground. Make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the acceleration the flea needs to have while straightening its legs, and state your answer in units of g, i.e., how many “g’s it pulls.”(For comparison, fighter pilots black out or die if they exceed about 5 or 10 g’s.) A person is parachute jumping. During the time between when she leaps out of the plane and when she opens her chute, her altitude is given by an equation of the form <br /><span class="math display">$$y=b-c(t+ke^{\frac{-t}{k}}),$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> is the base of natural logarithms, and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> are constants. Because of air resistance, her velocity does not increase at a steady rate as it would for an object falling in vacuum.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What units would <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> have to have for the equation to make sense?</p></li>

<li><p>Use your answer from part (b) to get an interpretation of the constant <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>. [Hint: <span class="math inline"><em>e</em><sup> − <em>x</em></sup></span> approaches zero for large values of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>.]</p></li>
<li><p>Find the person’s acceleration, <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>, as a function of time.</p></li>
