<p>What are the steps in the scientific process? What is the difference between something that is computationally secure and another that is information-theoretically secure? When is the sum of two vectors maximum? When is it minimum? A vector <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>î</em> + <em>b</em><em>ĵ</em> + <em>c</em><em>k̂</em></span> starts at the point (<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>,<span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>,<span class="math inline"><em>z</em><sub>1</sub></span>). At what point does it terminate? How do we know two vectors are parallel? List some common vectors and scalars. What is projection? Is the scalar triple product of three vectors scalar or vector? What are its applications?</p>
